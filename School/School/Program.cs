 * Write an applicaton that includes two additional methods in addition to the

 * lines of information about your school. The other method should return a 
 * string consisting of asterisks. First call the method that returns the string
 * of asterisks. Call the method that returns the asterisk a second time after you
 * invoke the method that displays the information about your school. Items you
 * might include are the name of your school, number of students enrolled, and 
 * school colors. Include appropriate labels. The display should be aesthetically
 * pleasing so include enough asterisks to surround your listing.
